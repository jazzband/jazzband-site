summary: Jazzband is accepted for the Fiscal Sponsorship program of the Python Software Foundation.

There were a number of requests to financially support Jazzband
over the years and many questions arose around how to continue to grow
Jazzband without risking the maintenance of the existing projects.

So to support the continued development of Jazzband,
an application to the [Fiscal Sponsorship program
of the Python Software Foundation][psf-fs] was submitted earlier this year.

And the good news is: **Jazzband has been accepted!**

That will allow Jazzband for the first time to receive donations from
its individual and corporate users to offset infrastructure cost and
work on plans for the future.
