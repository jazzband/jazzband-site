    <h3>Jazzband is a cooperative experiment to reduce the stress of maintaining Open Source software alone.</h3>
    <p>The goal of the Jazzband is to offer relief by sharing responsibility for open source work with other like-minded people. It offers maintainers and contributors the ability to play in the same band instead of being forced into “artist” and “audience” roles by the tools GitHub provides.</p>
